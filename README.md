# RClock
---
My attempt at creating a [tty-clock](https://github.com/xorg62/tty-clock) type tool to help me learn rust.

## Features
- Fun TUI interface
- Big ol' Clock showing you the time
- A Pomodoro style timer cycle with a progress bar

## Installation

So far you need to build it from source. I'll be honest, it's barely functional. Give it some time.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:adam-good/rclock.git
$ cd rclock
$ cargo build
```
I wouldn't do much more than this until it's farther along.

I don't even know what systems it builds on other than my desktop.

## Usage
While running:
- `q` to quit
- `<space>` to toggle pausing the pomodoro timer
